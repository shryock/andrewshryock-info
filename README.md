This is my personal website developed using primarily the Angular and Node.js JavaScript frameworks. Most of the README below was kept over from the AngularCLI README that was generated for the project.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server that build the project and then automatically opens a browser tab to the page on `http://localhost:4200/`.
Angular CLI will watch the working directory and then app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build for production

Run `ng build --prod --aot` to build the project for production. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
This will compile the project into a couple of JavaScript files, the main HTML file, the licenses files, and an images directory.
